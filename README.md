This was the final project for the MyDNS Intermediate Coding II. This is a website which allowed a user to register, login and then vote for a restaurant. It also had a "view results" page which displayed the total votes for the list of restaurants.

ABOUT THE PROJECT

Design and create a simple online Web-based Voting System for the best restaurant in Trinidad and Tobago. You will work on this program throughout the course and update it with features taught in every session. SCOPE

The Final Web-Based Application should have the following:

A Welcome page containing links to register, vote and view results. (5 marks)
The registration page should ask for the userâ€™s first name, last name, e-mail address and password. Data captured should be validated. (20 marks)
The voting page should list at least five (5) restaurants from which the user can ONLY vote for one. (10 marks)
For a vote to be counted the user must enter their correct username and password. This can be implemented by introducing an additional field for username or you can utilise the e-mail for this. (25 marks)
Data should be stored using a MYSQL database. Hint: You can use separate tables to store the votes for each restaurant. (25 marks) Marks will be allocated for layout and flow. (15 marks)
